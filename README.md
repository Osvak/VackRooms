### The VR Game based on the Backrooms creepypasta.

Hello! We are a group of students belonging to the university known as CITM, and what we are going to present to you next is a university project for the VR/AR subject. 
Our game is based on the creepypasta of the Backrooms, a mysterious and labyrinthine environment that is full of mysterious and mystical creatures. Your duty is to escape, and to do so, you will have to solve the puzzles you are presented with while making use of the tools you are given. Good luck, little misadventurer!

## Features
- 6 DoF!
- Possibility to grab things from the environment.
- Interacting with the environment (touching things, moving around).
- Movement based on tp's.
- Snap rotation (ready to be used in case it is considered necessary).
- Invisible object visualisation mechanics:
  - With an object you will be able to see things you couldn't see with the naked eye. It will be your best friend...
- Immersive audio based on the Backrooms lore.
- Labyrinthine rooms.
- Feeling of being lost and fear. >:)
